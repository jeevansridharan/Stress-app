<!-- 
This is a placeholder for calm-music.mp3
Since we cannot generate actual MP3 files, you have two options:

OPTION 1 - Use a free calm music file:
Download a free calm/relaxing audio from:
- https://pixabay.com/music/search/calm/
- https://freesound.org/
- https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html

Save it as "calm-music.mp3" in this folder.

OPTION 2 - Use online audio URL:
Edit index.html and replace the audio source with an online URL like:
https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3

OPTION 3 - Remove audio feature:
If you don't want audio, simply remove the audio element from index.html

For now, the app will work but the audio player will show as unavailable.
To test without audio, you can comment out the audio section in index.html.
